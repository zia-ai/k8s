                                  as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

                          treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation
                          of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains
                          with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                          this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when
                          the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                          scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those
                          domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains
                          is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                          When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
                          \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2,
                          MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector
                          spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P
                          P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains),
                          so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation,
                          new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled
                          to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This
                          is an alpha field and requires enabling MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread

                          as a domain whose nodes match the node selector. e.g. If

                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. (Beta) Using this field

                        is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable
                        the EphemeralContainers feature.

                          no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not
                          be restarted when they exit or when a pod is removed or
                          restarted. If an ephemeral container causes a pod to exceed
                          its resource allocation, the pod may be evicted. Ephemeral
                          containers may not be added by directly updating the pod
                          spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers

                                  exits. The reason for termination is passed to the
                                  handler. The Pod''s termination grace period countdown
                                  begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless
                                  of the outcome of the handler, the container will
                                  eventually terminate within the Pod''s termination
                                  grace period. Other management of the container
                                  blocks until the hook completes or until the termination
                                  grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks'

                              inside a container will be accessible from the network.

                        creating a pod, and it cannot be modified by updating the

                        pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource. This field
                        is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable
                        the EphemeralContainers feature.

                          no resource or scheduling guarantees, and they will not
                          be restarted when they exit or when a pod is removed or
                          restarted. If an ephemeral container causes a pod to exceed
                          its resource allocation, the pod may be evicted. Ephemeral
                          containers may not be added by directly updating the pod
                          spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers
                          subresource, and they will appear in the pod spec once added.

                                  a container is terminated due to an API request
                                  or management event such as liveness/startup probe
                                  failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The
                                  handler is not called if the container crashes or
                                  exits. The reason for termination is passed to the
                                  handler. The Pod''s termination grace period countdown
                                  begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless
                                  of the outcome of the handler, the container will
                                  eventually terminate within the Pod''s termination
                                  grace period. Other management of the container
                                  blocks until the hook completes or until the termination
                                  grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks'
